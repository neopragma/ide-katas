# IDE Kata

This project contains _kata_ that are meant to be useful for practicing IDE keyboard shortcuts as well as common refactoring sequences, with emphasis on using keyboard shortcuts to facilitate refactoring. The idea is to speed up the process of getting keyboard shortcuts into our muscle memory when we're learning a new IDE or returning to an IDE we haven't used in a while.

You wouldn't repeat these _kata_ hundreds of times, as you might do with programming _kata_. You only need to repeat these until you know the shortcuts well enough that you don't have to break your train of thought to look them up when you're in the middle of real work.
